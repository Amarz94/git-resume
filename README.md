# Git-Resume
### The resume builder for developers!

## Introduction
A free service to help you create a resume from your GitHub profile using the [GitHub Rest API][git-rest-api].

## User Story
Use your GitHub profile and information to dynamically build a simple and beautiful, developer-focused resume for your next job. 

## A Simple Mock-Up Made With [Balsamiq][balsamiq]
![Screenshot MockUp][ssmu]
This is a simple mock-up made by @Mconway409 and inspired by @davidsaulrodriguez

## The [Tailwind 2.0][tailwind] Framework

For CSS we've decided to use Tailwind as it is light weight, gets out of the way and makes for a stuningly beautiful, yet simple website.

## We use both vanilla [JavaScript][javascript] and [jQuery][jquery].

For added functionality we are using both vanilla JavaScript and jQuery to keep our codebase light and efficent.
